## Overview

jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selections.
When an event occurs, the provided function is executed.  Inside the function,
this refers to the element that was clicked.

The event handling function can receive an event object. This object can be
used to determine the nature of the event, and to prevent the eventâ€™s default
behavior.
